This is a series of experiments so that I can learn more about Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Over the course of several months, I plan to build out a tile-based, simulation game of life on Hoth before the invasion taking inspiration from other construction sims like [drawf fortress](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/02/dwarf-fortress-ten-hours-with-the-most-inscrutable-video-game-of-all-time/)

I'll be using Javascript and Python to create these experiments featuring authors as I go.
