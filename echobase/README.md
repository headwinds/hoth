# Storybook

I really like the idea of Storybook as a way to share and display individual components outside of a larger system. In reality, it's more challenging to maintain and typically ends up with a handful instead of the whole lot. Still, I've included one here as a best practice and something to try out if you've never seen Storybook before.  

```
yarn run storybook
```
