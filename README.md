# HOTH

I want to get back to blogging; an emphasis on the LOG. I like the concept of a Ship Captain's log where instead of writing an entire article, the captain would capture what happened that day or over a brief peroid of time. The entries would add to a post with an over arching themes along with a few tangents.    

I'm going to use my last post of 2106, [Redux Table](http://headwinds.net/2016/04/redux-data-table/), as a starting point for this new design. 

For this project, I also want to use python to mine any data and use a standard apache server instead of relying on a nodejs. [Cabin Quest](http://cabinquest-50966.onmodulus.net/#!/) is my separate NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB project. While my node project is hosted on Modulus, my blog is hosted on the cheapest GoDaddy account I could find and doesn't support Node. This is all about having interesting and educational side proejcts that don't break the bank. 

It's also nice to have a project that doesn't try to do everthing so that I can focus on learning new approaches. In this project, I would like to concentrate on improving a few things:

* how to load scss from the same directory as my component
* how I can setup eslint to visually lint while I code
* get better at unit testing with Karma & Jasmine 
* how do I add (HMR) Hot Module Replacement so that I can see my results without refreshing the browser
* learn the new approaches in D3 v4
* implement complex table interactions with redux hooks
