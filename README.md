# HOTH

This is my morning experimental project and log. 

### Rituals

My morning ritual includes:

* showering where I wake up my brain and plan major goals for the day
* taking my 2 daugters (2 & 5) to school
* 3KM walk to work (24-7) where I refine my game plan while listening to podcasts
* I'm usually at my desk around 8:30. 
* I have coffee & cereal 
* fire up my machine and open this project
* work on a side project for 2 hrs 

### Contributing

If you fork this project, obviously your morning ritual will be different. Actually I don't expect any forks and certainly no pull requests at this point since this is primarily a solo project but I would be happy to discuss any ideas.

### Personal Reporting

I want to get back to open, personal research and blogging an emphasis on the LOG. I like the concept of a Ship Captain's log where instead of writing an entire article, the captain would capture what happened that day or over a brief peroid of time. The entries would add to a post with an over arching themes along with a few tangents.    

On Jan 1st/2017, I started using [Reporter](http://www.reporter-app.com/) to help track my personal data and with the plan to visualize it; possibly quarterly depending on what it looks like by then.  

I'm going to use my last post of 2016, [Redux Table](http://headwinds.net/2016/04/redux-data-table/), as a starting point for this new design. 

For this project, I also want to use python to mine any data and use a standard apache server instead of relying on a nodejs. 
[Cabin Quest](http://cabinquest-50966.onmodulus.net/#!/) is my separate NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB project that feeds [Porthole](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/porthole/dilfffpckfhcpgidnmgaeoidgekcjlln?hl=en), a chrome extension. While my node project is hosted on Modulus, my blog is hosted on the cheapest GoDaddy account I could find and doesn't support Node. This is all about having interesting and educational side proejcts that don't break the bank. 

It's also nice to have a project that doesn't try to do everthing so that I can focus on learning new approaches. In this project, I would like to concentrate on improving a few things:

### Goals

* how to load scss from the same directory as my component (also investigate the advantages of postCSS/linting CSS)
* how I can setup eslint to visually lint while I code
* get better at unit testing with Karma & Jasmine 
* how do I add (HMR) Hot Module Replacement so that I can see my results without refreshing the browser
* learn the new approaches in D3 v4
* implement complex table interactions with redux hooks
* explore how python can mine twitter and process tweets with NLP
* attempt to learn something new everyday 
* attempt to contribute something more meaningful/spiritual that spotlights environmental concerns
