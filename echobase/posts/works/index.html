  As a challenge, I wanted to prototype a visualization that mines massive amounts of chat data and uses NLP to classify and measure each line of text in the transcript based on several weights. For each conversation between agent and customer, the text is processed and scored based on duration, topic, action, and sentiment. These scores are tallied into an overall signal strength.

  <strong>Voices</strong> [ 100% complete&nbsp;v2.0.0 released| Java BackboneJS & Angular 2 D3 ]
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 This has been my longest running project in my career spanning 4 years, and I have had the privilege of working on it starting a few months after its inception and then shepharding it through 2 major releases. As the sole front-end resource following an Agile development cycle, I would spend some sprints conceptualizing, wireframing, and designing mock ups that I would present to our stake holders and customers then later implement the results constanlty iterating and sharing. Like Signals, I had a lot of oppurnity to prototype and show early work to both internal and public customers.

 My favourite aspect of this application in the visualization of a customer journey. There are two versions in the app that allow the custom to explore the data as a cluster and a tree. Each node can be opened to reveal further demographic details.

<p><strong>Porthole</strong> [ 100% complete&nbsp;v1.5 released | Mongodb Express Angular Node]</p>
<p>
  <img src="works/porhole.png">
</p>
<p>On the day google reader died, I had an epiphany that I could replace it with something more personal; that something would combine RSS feeds with my love of minimal indie games with a lofty goal of having the feeds somehow influence the game play.</p>
<p>I’m releasing the first piece of this puzzle, code-named Porthole, which you can <a href="http://www.headwinds.net/lab/porthole/">bookmark here</a> for all browsers or install it as a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/porthole/dilfffpckfhcpgidnmgaeoidgekcjlln">Google Chrome Extension</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, there are no game mechanics and it’s fairly simple RSS feed with a minimal, full browser photo look that I find compelling and I hope you do too. Now, it’s just a matter of adding some gaming hooks that would explore whether you’d rather travel to Muskoka or Mars.</p>
<p><strong>Meta Match</strong> [ 50% complete&nbsp;v0.5.0 | Python Angular 1 ]</p>
<p>
<img src="./works/scarlett.png" alt="alive vs scarlett"></p>
</p>
<p>Have you played starcraft and wondered why your game was going sideways? Meta Match presents games from the best players in the world and slow downs their intense games so that you can analyze their build orders and learn how to better counter your opponent&nbsp;in your own games.</p>
<p><a title="metamatch" href="http://starcraftmetamatch.appspot.com/">Meta Match</a>&nbsp;concentrates on presenting build order timings and also tests &nbsp;player knowledge of game units and tech trees.</p>

<p><strong>Ultimate Score Keeper | 100% complete v1.0 released | iOS Obejective C</strong></p>
<p>After constantly forgetting to bring something to record our score while playing Ultimate frisbee, I designed and developed the <a title="Ultimate Score Keeper" href="http://www.headwinds.net/apps/iOS/ultimateScoreKeeper/ultimate_score_keeper.html">Ultimate score keeper</a> to do just that. It also has the ability to email scores and a built-in database to save scores and game strategies.</p>
<p><img src="./works/appUK.png" alt="ultimate score keeper"></p>
<p>This iPhone app allows you:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep track of the score for several sports</li>
<li>automatically drafts emails based on the score</li>
<li>take brief, strategic game notes</li>
<li>provides a history so that you can review past game scores and strategies</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s the perfect app for recording brief strategies which you can review later and help you prepare for your next match!</p>

<p><strong>Favourite Prototypes</strong></p>
<p>In 2011, while at Blast Radius, I built this very simple bracket based on the concept of tweeting your score and having the app parse the twitter feed to display who advances to the final.</p>

<p><strong>Code Sketches &amp; Other Web Hacks</strong></p>
<p>As a hybrid designer/developer who builds enterprise apps for a living, I want to challenge myself and really nerd out, exploring and sampling indie gaming mechanics with science and fantasy. </p>
<p>As of 2016, I like Angular 2 with Typescript within a Node/Express app against MongoDB. I’m also messing around with React/Redux.</p>
